    <!-- Chosen Palette: Parchment & Ink -->
    <!-- Application Structure Plan: The SPA uses a top navigation bar to switch between thematic views (Dashboard, Adventures, Cast, Atlas, Lore, Toolkit). This non-linear structure is designed for a Dungeon Master's workflow, allowing quick access to specific information during a live game session, which is more efficient than scrolling through a linear document. The core of the 'Adventures' view is an interactive flowchart, visually mapping the campaign progression. The 'Cast' and 'Atlas' sections use searchable and filterable card grids for rapid lookup of characters and locations. This design prioritizes usability and quick information retrieval over mirroring the source report's sequential layout. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices:
        Report Info: Campaign Timeline -> Goal: Visualize plot progression -> Viz/Presentation: Interactive HTML/CSS flowchart -> Interaction: Click a node to view detailed information for that campaign part -> Justification: Provides a clear, at-a-glance overview of the story's flow and how adventures connect.
        Report Info: NPC/Monster descriptions -> Goal: Organize for quick lookup -> Viz/Presentation: Filterable/Searchable card grid -> Interaction: Search by name, filter by type (Ally, Antagonist, etc.), click for full details -> Justification: Far superior to text search for in-game speed.
        Report Info: Escalating threat level -> Goal: Inform DM of rising stakes -> Viz/Presentation: Chart.js Line Chart -> Interaction: Tooltips on hover -> Justification: Gives an immediate visual sense of the campaign's dramatic arc.
        Report Info: Relationships between characters -> Goal: Clarify allegiances -> Viz/Presentation: HTML/CSS connection diagram -> Interaction: Hover to highlight connections -> Justification: Quickly shows who is allied with or opposed to whom, especially Kaelen's network.
        Report Info: Glossary/Rules -> Goal: Quick reference -> Viz/Presentation: Searchable list -> Interaction: Search term to find definition -> Justification: Faster than manual lookup.
        CONFIRMING NO SVG/Mermaid, supporting the DESIGNED structure. Library/Method: Vanilla JS, Tailwind CSS, Chart.js for all elements. -->
    <!-- CONFIRMATION: NO SVG graphics used. NO Mermaid JS used. -->

The cult's goal is to unravel the natural cycle of life and death, transforming the world into a realm of eternal undeath where their dark patron can manifest. The heroes will uncover this conspiracy piece by piece, as each adventure reveals another facet of Kaelen's grand plan.</p>
                    <p>Opposing this decay is **Somnia the Dreamweaver**, a deity of growth and potential who aids the heroes through dreams and divine gifts, acting as a crucial counterbalance to the cult's dark influence.</p>
