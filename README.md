The "CRAPPING Compendium" outlines a simplified tabletop role-playing game (TTRPG) system designed specifically for young players (ages 8-14). Its core philosophy prioritizes accessibility, fun, and collaborative storytelling over complex rules, aiming to provide a beginner-friendly adaptation for long-term campaigns up to Level 20. The system emphasizes visual progression, fast-paced combat, clear success metrics with immediate rewards, and gradual introduction of complexity to foster engagement and a strong sense of player achievement.
